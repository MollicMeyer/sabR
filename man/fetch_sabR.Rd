\arguments{
\item{raster_path}{Path to directory containing raster folders (e.g., "T:/IA-Kitchen/results/maps").}

\item{props}{Character vector of soil properties to load (e.g., "sand", "clay").}

\item{PSDnormalize}{Logical; whether to use normalized PSD rasters (sand, silt, clay sum to 100\%).}

\item{clip_shapefile}{Optional path to shapefile to clip rasters to.}

\item{resample_res}{Resolution to resample to (numeric); set to NULL to skip resampling.}

\item{resample_method}{Method used for resampling (e.g., "bilinear", "cubic").}

\item{output_dir}{Optional path to save combined raster stack (GeoTIFF).}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\describe{
\item{stack}{A \code{SpatRaster} of selected rasters.}
\item{product}{The string \code{"SABR"} for consistency.}
\item{file_paths}{Paths of included raster files.}
}
}
\description{
Loads a local directory of SABR soil raster data into a unified SpatRaster stack.
Supports optional normalization, clipping, and resampling.
