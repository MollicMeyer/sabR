\title{Extract Raster Values from Points to SoilProfileCollection}
\usage{
sabRpts_to_spc(
  stack,
  pts,
  props = c("sand", "clay", "TOC", "pH"),
  depths = c("0-5", "5-15", "15-30"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{stack}{SpatRaster; the raster stack to extract values from (e.g., output from \code{fetch_sabR()$stack})}

\item{pts}{Character path, sf object, SpatVector, or SpatRaster; spatial points for extraction}

\item{props}{Character vector; soil properties to include (e.g., props = c("sand", "clay"))}

\item{depths}{Character vector; depth intervals to use (e.g., depths = c("0-5", "5-15"))}

\item{new_depths}{Numeric vector; new standard horizons (e.g., new_depths = c(0, 20, 40, 60))}

\item{source}{Character; used to append to unique ID (e.g., source = "SABR")}
}
\value{
A SoilProfileCollection with values from raster layers at point locations
}
\description{
Converts raster data at specified point locations into a SoilProfileCollection.
