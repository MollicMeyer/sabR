}
\arguments{
\item{stack}{SpatRaster; the raster stack (e.g., output from \code{fetch_sabR()$stack})}

\item{aoi}{Character path, sf object, SpatVector, or SpatRaster; the area of interest (polygons or extent)}

\item{zones}{Character vector; values in the \code{id_column} to extract (e.g., c("Zone1", "Zone2"))}

\item{id_column}{Character; name of column in \code{aoi} used as profile ID (e.g., id_column = "Name")}

\item{props}{Character vector; soil properties to include (e.g., props = c("sand", "clay"))}

\item{depths}{Character vector; depth intervals (e.g., depths = c("0-5", "5-15"))}

\item{new_depths}{Numeric vector; new depth bins to aggregate to (e.g., c(0, 15, 30))}

\item{stats}{Character vector; statistics to compute (e.g., stats = c("mean", "sd"))}

\item{source}{Character; string to prefix each profile ID (e.g., source = "SABR")}
}
\value{
A list of SoilProfileCollections, one per statistic
}
\description{
Computes zonal summary statistics for polygons and converts them to SoilProfileCollection.
